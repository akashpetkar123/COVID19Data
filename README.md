# COVID19 Data
Test analysis of COVID19 Data

The data has been downloaded from this website:-
https://api.covid19india.org/states_daily.json

It consist of daily cases of covid19 data everydata. The data consist of confirmed,deceased and recovered cases. The data is in JSON so we need to convert the data into a tabulation structure then we can understand the data in a more meaningful way. The data consist of all the states in india.
It also gives a column where on a regular date where each day all around india how many cases has been identified i.e given by tt
Here a shortversion of data has been described as mh for Maharashtra, tn for Tamil Nadu, dl for Delhi etc
This is a test project where we download the data convert into json using json library and convert into a tabulation structure. After it is converted into tabulation, we then style the data using panda's style frame then we highlight the data in "red" color which is highest for the state in day and "green" color which is lowest for the state in a day, so this makes sense that in which state cases are increasing and decreasing.
This is just a test project to understand how it can be implemented.
